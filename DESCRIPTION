Description: Power and sample size calculations for a variety of study designs and 
    outcomes. Methods include t tests, ANOVA (including tests for interactions, 
    simple effects and contrasts), proportions, categorical data (chi-square tests 
    and proportional odds), linear, logistic and Poisson regression, alternative 
    and coprimary endpoints, power for confidence intervals, correlation 
    coefficient tests, cluster randomized trials, individually randomized group 
    treatment trials, multisite trials, treatment-by-covariate interaction effects 
    and nonparametric tests of location. Utilities are provided for 
    computing various effect sizes. Companion package to the book 
    "Power and Sample Size in R", Crespi (2025, ISBN:9781138591622).
